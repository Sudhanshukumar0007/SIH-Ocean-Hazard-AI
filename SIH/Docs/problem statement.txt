Organization: Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)
Title: Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics
Category: Software
Theme: Disaster Management

🔎 What it Means

The Ministry of Earth Sciences wants a platform that:

Collects hazard-related information from people (crowdsourcing).

Example: Fishermen, coastal residents, travelers reporting unusual tides, oil spills, floods, or accidents.

Could be done via a mobile/web app where people submit text, images, or GPS-tagged reports.

Analyzes social media activity for early signals of hazards.

Example: Detect tweets, Facebook/Instagram posts, or local WhatsApp discussions about “huge waves in Chennai” or “oil spill in Odisha coast”.

Use AI/NLP tools to extract keywords, detect anomalies, classify whether it’s relevant to hazards.

Integrates both data sources (citizen reports + social media monitoring) into one dashboard.

Show hazard reports on a map (with geolocation).

Highlight trends or alerts (spike in flood mentions in Kerala).

Provide actionable insights for disaster response teams.

🛠️ Core Functionalities

Crowdsourcing App/Portal

Simple app where people can upload hazard reports with:

Text description

Photos/videos

GPS location

Could also allow voice-based input (useful in rural areas).

Social Media Analytics

Use APIs (Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube comments, etc.) to fetch posts.

Run NLP + sentiment analysis to detect hazard-related content.

Detect spikes in discussions (e.g., sudden rise in “cyclone”, “flood”, “earthquake”).

AI Models

Classification: Filter out irrelevant posts.

Anomaly detection: Identify unusual patterns.

Geotagging: Map posts to specific coastal regions.

Visualization Dashboard

Map view with pins for reported hazards.

Graphs showing trend analysis of keywords.

Alert system (color-coded severity levels).

🎯 Expected Prototype (for SIH demo)

You don’t need to build a full-scale production system. Instead, show:

Mobile/web mockup (React/Flutter/Figma demo) where a user reports a hazard.

Dataset simulation (take sample tweets, e.g., “Tsunami warning Chennai” + random noise).

AI processing: Run a simple NLP pipeline (keyword detection, sentiment analysis, classification).

Dashboard: Map + alert visualization (Flask/Django backend with Leaflet/Google Maps API).

This will convince judges you’ve cracked the core idea.

🚀 Why It’s Powerful

Leverages citizens as sensors (crowdsourcing).

Uses AI-powered OSINT (social media) for real-time situational awareness.

Helps MoES respond faster to cyclones, tsunamis, floods, oil spills, accidents.
